###Abel's Photographic Memory Game

-The photo memory game was built by using html, css, javaScript and jQuery.
The use of HTML was rather limited as I only used it to create "templates"
for the various photo slides.

-There's minimum styling with CSS since there photos take up most of the screen.
I used Google Fonts "Bangers"

-The design approached was rather unorthodox. I started to build the top of the pyramid without ancient aliens technology.
I used my own personal photos as the main design. At least something will look good :)

###Getting Started (unboxing)
Shake your computer for 10 seconds and place on a firm table. Go to my github (http://shotbyabel.github.io/) i.o link.
1. The purpose of the game is to look at 5 different photographs and try to remember as many details about them.
2. You have 4 seconds to view it before it switches to a question about the photo.
3. There will be multple choice of A and B answers.
4. Final scores will be tallied.
5. You have 60 over all seconds to complete the game.

###Unsolved issues and updates

1. The game is not truly 2 player.
2. Final Scores have not been programmed to add up or be viewed.
3. The timers are build in but have no been implemented yet. 
4. Created a 2nd player's photo slides.
